However, this is often problematic as this imposes an order and a distance between the different categories, that might not accurately reflect the semantics of the data. Both pandas and scikit-learn by default use the lexical ordering of categories, so MORTGAGE corresponds to 0, OWN to 1 and RENT to 2. This order makes little sense. We could specify our own ordering, say RENT, MORTGAGE, OWN (describing degrees of ownership) but this is also not entirely satisfactory: if we encode it using integers, we postulate that the difference between RENT and MORTGAGE is the same as the difference between MORTGAGE and OWN, and the difference between RENT and OWN is twice the distance between MORTGAGE and OWN. Making these assumption seems somewhat questionable, and in many cases, even ordering the categories might be hard - imagine working on a dataset of cars that includes the color, imposing any ordering there seems very arbitray."

    "## Selecting columns by type\n",
    "If there are many columns, such as in the full lending club data, it can sometimes be a challenge to determine the types and correct preprocessing for all of them.\n",
    "Usually, it pays of to understand each individual column, and invest some time understanding the meaning of all the values, plotting them, and so on.\n",
    "For example, for integer values it might not be obvious whether they should be one-hot-encoded or not. The annual salary amount in the lending club data is continuous, but the easiest way to actually be certain about that is to know what the data represents. We know salary, or really any amount of money, will be continuous. Luckily in this dataset all the categorical variable are represented as strings, and so it's relatively easy to understand what they mean.\n",
    "But without additional information, if a column contains small integers, these could either correspond to a continuous quantity, or be an encoding for categories.\n",

    "This somewhat tricky case aside, for some quick plotting or prototyping, it might sometimes be enough to look at just the dtype of the columns.\n",

    "In some communities, one-hot encoding refers to using one column per category, while dummy encoding refers to leaving out one of them. Using this nomenclature, ``pd.get_dummies`` does one-hot encoding by default.\n",
    "In pandas and scikit-learn the terms are used interchangeably and we're using them interchangeably in this book. TODO is this a good idea?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Coming back to one-hot encoding, there's one more important thing to know, which is that one-hot encoding is redundant. We can drop one of the columns for each categorical variable and still retain all the information: if all of the other columns are zero, the dropped one was 1, and if one of them is 1, the dropped one was 0. In other words, you could re-compute a column as one minus the sum of the other columns. Such a relationship is known as collinearity (or linear dependency). For some statistical models, the presence of such a relationship between the features can lead to numerical and statistical issues. Therefore, it is common in statistics to drop one of the columns. You can do that in pandas by using ``pd.get_dummies(X, drop_first=True)`` which will drop the first category for each feature:"

Also, if a category appears only rarely, of just once, then the feature will be deceptively informative. If there is just one sample, the feature will encode just the target of this row. This is a typical case of information leakage. The resulting model is likely to learn that this column is particularly useful, though this knowledge will not translate to unseen data.\n",

    "Categorical variables are quite common in many different settings, and while some models might be able to deal with them natively, preprocessing is necessary for most machine learning models. Using one-hot-encoding is the most common method and usually a good place to start. If there are many categories, it might be useful to encode only the most common ones, and combine all the infrequent ones.\n",
    "Another common approach to dealing with categorical variables with many categories is target encoding, which is implemented in several variants in the ``category_encoders`` package."
